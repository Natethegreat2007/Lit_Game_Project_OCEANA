This coral is pale, white and skinny...I wonder what created this?
Turneffe Atoll, from my memory, did not have this many pale coral
The ocean's temperature has felt warmer than usual as the days go by...and the warmer it gets...the paler the coral gets..
That's a sign that they are dying....
That explains why not many fish and sea creatures are around...
They are all....
