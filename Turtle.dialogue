Green Sea Turtle: Did you know that the Great Blue Hole was created due to the collapase of a cave system?
Green Sea Turtle: Because it is a submerged cavern, there are stalactites and columns in here! The ambience is just stellar.
Green Sea Turtle: Additionally, it is around 120 meters deep and 318 meters wide...wouldn't want to swim too deep in here if I were you...
